From what I've learned, black holes are regions in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. They are formed when a massive star collapses in on itself.\n",

When a massive star runs out of fuel, this balance is disrupted. Without the outward pressure, the star begins to collapse under its own gravity.\n",

            "As the star collapses, the core becomes incredibly dense. I think this is where the concept of a singularity comes in—the center of the black hole where the density is infinite and the laws of physics as we know them break down.
