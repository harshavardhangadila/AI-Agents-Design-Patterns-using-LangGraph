### LangGraph Agent Patterns: 7 Practical Designs with LangSmith Traces and using Groq llama3-8b-8192
This repository demonstrates seven powerful agentic design patterns implemented with LangGraph, showcasing robust AI agent workflows. Each section includes detailed Mermaid diagrams, practical Python implementations, and comprehensive tracing via LangSmith, enabling easy debugging and step-by-step visibility into agent decision-making processes powered by Groq LLMs.

### CrewAI Agent Patterns: 7 Practical Designs using Groq DeepSeek LLaMA 70B
This repository demonstrates seven powerful agent patterns implemented with CrewAI and Groq's deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b. Each design includes detailed workflows, clearly defined agent roles, practical Python implementations, and executable Colab examples for ease of experimentation.




| # | Pattern                    | Description                                                                                                  | 
|---|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | **Augmented LLM (Tool Use)**   | Enhances LLMs by explicitly delegating arithmetic computations to external tools through iterative workflow. | 
| 2 | **Prompt Chaining**            | Chains sequential prompts where each step improves upon the previous one, enabling refined outcomes.      | 
| 3 | **Parallelization**            | Executes multiple independent tasks concurrently, then combines results into a unified output.            | 
| 4 | **Routing**                    | Dynamically routes queries to specialized handlers based on LLM-driven classification.                    | 
| 5 | **Orchestrator-Worker**        | Employs an orchestrator to plan and delegate subtasks to workers, merging outputs into a complete result. | 
| 6 | **Evaluator-Optimizer**        | Implements iterative generation and evaluation loops until outputs meet defined quality criteria.         |
| 7 | **ReAct Agent**                | Combines reasoning and action, planning step-by-step tool usage and adapting dynamically based on results. |
